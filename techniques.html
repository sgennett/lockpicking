        In the world of lock-sport, there are three foundational methods.
         Each approach has its own applications, level of precision, and
          learning curve. Read on to find out more about them all.

        <h2>Single-Pin Picking</h2>
        <div class="method">
          <img src="SPPmethod.jpg" alt="How to Single Pin Pick">
          <p>While applying rotational tension, insert your pick and attempt to set pins 
            one at a time, feeling for each binding pin as you work your way back. Itâ€™s 
            precise, effective, and surprisingly quick in the hands of a skilled picker. 
            This is a tried and true method preferred by professionals that works on 
            virtually any pin-and-tumbler lock.</p>

      <div id="rake" class="detail">
        <h2>Raking</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Insert your tension tool and apply light tension.</li>
          <li>Rapidly insert and remove the rake to bounce pins above the shear line.</li>
          <li>If you're successful, you'll feel your tension wrench give, and you can then turn it like a key to open.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="warning">
          Raking can damage pins in delicate locks. Use gentle force.

      <div id="bump" class="detail">
        <h2>Bumping</h2>
        <div class="method">
          <img src="bumpkey.jpg" alt="Kwikset KW1 Bump Key with Rubber Ring">
          <p>A specially cut key (bump key) is tapped to transfer kinetic energy upwards into the pins.
            You may notice the key cuts are done very low and all at the same height. 
             Apply rotational tension to the key while slightly bumping the back with a rubber mallet. 
             Quick method that can open a lock in seconds, but it's noisy and requires a 
             specially cut key. </p>
